# Hi there! 
We are happy you are going to play the battle game we created. It's going to be exciting! :)

Before you start, our team wants to explain you a little bit how it is going to work, so keep reading.

The game is a battle game, it has two parties - one is yours and another one - is computer's one.
Both parties are going to have 4 players.

As long as you will have your own party, you will be allowed to choose the way your party is going to be created:
- manually;
- computer generated;
- uploaded from the csv file;

After you have a party created you will be able to start playing. The detailed party is going to be shown on the console,
and you will have to choose one player of your team and type its name in the console, so the battle will start. 

After the battle round is finished, you will see the result of it, updated list of your team and the graveyard list if any
of the players have died after the fight. After that, you will need to choose a player again and the fight will start again.

You will need to keep choosing a player till all your or opponent's party members are dead so the game is finished.
When that happens the winner team is going to be displayed on the screen.

So now, you are ready to go, just enter the game, run the project and follow the instructions shown on the console.

Let's see who will win - either you, either computer :)

Enjoy!!!
